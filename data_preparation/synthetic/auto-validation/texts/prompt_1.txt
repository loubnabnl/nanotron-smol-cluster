Write a comprehensive and in-depth textbook on 'Principles of Macroeconomics for APÂ® Courses 2e', tailored for college students.
We are writing on chapter 'The Keynesian Perspective'. In particular, section 'The Expenditure-Output (or Keynesian Cross) Model'. We have already covered the following unit in this section: 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Consumption as a Function of National Income'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'Investment as a Function of National Income'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income', 'Investment as a Function of National Income', 'Investment as a Function of National Income', 'Investment as a Function of National Income', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Investment as a Function of National Income', 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line', 'The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Investment as a Function of National Income', 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Consumption as a Function of National Income'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model', 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps', 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule', 'Where Equilibrium Occurs', 'Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income', 'The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'Where Equilibrium Occurs', 'Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps'. We have already covered the following units in this section: 'The Multiplier Effect', 'Consumption as a Function of National Income', 'Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income', 'Calculating the Multiplier', 'Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule'. Write a new unit titled 'Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions'. Here's some text for inspiration: Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of \$100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by \$100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be \$100/2.13 = \$47. Government spending of approximately \$47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of \$100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of \$800, as [link] shows.

Try to be:

- Rigorous: Ensure very detailed and in-depth coverage of the concepts.
- Engaging: Write with an academic and engaging tone that captivates interest.
- Applied: Use specific and practical examples. For example, if the topic is integration in calculus, include equations and proofs of the concept you're teaching. As another example, if the topic is the history of the United States, include dates, names, and key events.
If there are mathematical expressions use a correct LateX formatting. Do not use images and avoid introductory phrases such as "welcome to this unit" at the beginning or conclusions the end.
